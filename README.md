# Introduction

This is a pretty OpenGL spectroscope for the awesome [JUCE](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE) cross platform C++ programming framework.

## Usage

This repository is meant to be included as a git submodule in a main project, see for instance [JammerNetz](https://github.com/christofmuc/JammerNetz) for an example how this is used.
In order to build this library standalone, which is what the CI server should be doing, there is a separate little repository that you can use. 

## Licensing

As some substantial work has gone into the development of this and related software, I decided to offer a dual license - AGPL, see the LICENSE.md file for the details, for everybody interested in how this works and willing to spend some time her- or himself on this, and a commercial MIT license available from me on request. Thus I can help the OpenSource community without blocking possible commercial applications.

## Contributing

All pull requests and issues welcome, I will try to get back to you as soon as I can. Due to the dual licensing please be aware that I will need to request transfer of copyright on accepting a PR.
